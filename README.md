# üîÆ LLM Astrologer

This project is an **LLM-Powered astrologer** built under selection task by **vedaz** organization. It predicts your **future plans** and provides **essential astrological details** in a conversational style.  
<br>

## üåü Live Examples

Here are some example queries and answers generated by the model:

### Example 1
```
User: What does my career look like in 2026?  
LLM: The year 2026 shows positive transitions in your professional life. You may receive recognition for your hard work, and opportunities for leadership roles are highlighted 
```

### Example 2
```
User: Should I focus on higher studies or a job right now?
LLM: The alignment suggests pursuing higher studies will broaden your opportunities. A career shift may follow once you complete your education.
```
### Example 3
```
User: Tell me something about my relationship path.
LLM: You are likely to experience stronger emotional connections in the coming phase. Commitment and stability will gradually take center stage.
```
‚ö° *The LLM is not a real astrologer ‚Äî it blends language understanding with predictive-style responses for experimentation and fun.*

## üß† Sliding Memory Algorithm

To make conversations more natural, the bot uses a **sliding memory window**.  
It remembers the **last 3 interactions (user + assistant pairs)**, which helps the LLM recall context like your name or previous questions.  

### Example Conversation with Memory:
```json
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a Bot"},

  {"role": "user", "content": "Hi there I am Nishant Singh"},  
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey Nishant, How are you"},  

  {"role": "user", "content": "Who is the prime minister of India"},  
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Narendra Modi is current prime minister of India"},  

  {"role": "user", "content": "What's my name"},  
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your name is Nishant.. as of our previous conversation"}  
]
```
<br>
